# Hop-game
My first GUI based 2D game designed using Pygame
Its my first game and i made it just for fun. It took me a total of 6hrs to build this, i know its a lot of time but i am just a biginer.
I would love to have any inputs or changes that you wana make in this game. To run this game all you have to do is create a folder and copy all files to it then install pygame to your python and run the code.
